# React Learning Project - Weather app

Welcome to my React Learning Project! This project is focused on React, a popular front-end framework for building user interfaces. Over the next couple of weeks, I will be exploring various concepts related to React to enhance my skills and add to my portfolio.

## Before I Begin

Before diving into the project, I took a moment to read the following byte about [React: âš¡ What is React?](https://hackmd.io/s/ByMAYN-FN) This provided me with a high-level overview of React and its significance in modern web development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to confidently answer "yes" to the following questions:

1. Can I explain what React is?
2. Do I understand the difference between JSX and HTML?
3. Can I explain the distinction between state and props in React?
4. Am I able to write tests for React components using React Testing Library?
5. Do I comprehend how events work in React and how to handle them effectively?
6. Can I make requests to a server and process the response data in a React application?
7. Am I capable of handling errors in JavaScript, particularly within a React context?

## Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, I will explore the following key concepts:

- **React**: Understanding the core principles and functionality of React.
- **JSX**: Differentiating between JSX and HTML syntax and their usage within React components.
- **Props**: Exploring the concept of props and how they facilitate component communication.
- **State**: Understanding state management in React and its role in dynamic component behavior.
- **Stateful Components**: Creating components that manage their own state.
- **Stateless (Presentational) Components**: Building components focused solely on rendering UI based on props.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizing React Hooks to manage state and side effects.
- **React Testing Library**: Writing tests using React Testing Library to ensure component functionality.
- **Request/Response**: Making HTTP requests to a server and processing the response data within a React application.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms in JavaScript and React.

## Project Setup

To get started with this project, I followed these steps:

1. I installed the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`
2. I explored the project structure and familiarized myself with the existing files and folders.
3. I began working through the provided exercises and examples to deepen my understanding of React concepts.
4. I referred to external resources, documentation, and the React community for additional support and guidance.
